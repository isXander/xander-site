# :wave: I'm Xander

I create Minecraft mods using Java and Kotlin, I love doing what I'm doing.
My mods are on [GitHub](https://github.com/isXander?tab=repositories&q=minecraft+mod),
[Curseforge](https://www.curseforge.com/members/xanderisdev) and
[Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/user/isxander). I occasionally do commission work for Minecraft mods
if I see a request that particularly interests me or I feel like it will help further my learning
and experiences. I have also tinkered with some statistical analysis and AI with
[Python](https://github.com/isXander?tab=repositories&language=python).

Another passion of mine is photography. You can read more about that and see some pictures I've taken
[here](/photography). I've got a camera, drone and a phone with a good camera system.

# My Successes

## Personal Minecraft Mods

As of the end of April 2023, I have reached over 17 million total downloads on
[Curseforge](https://www.curseforge.com/members/xanderisdev) alone, making a nice bonus of revenue,
my most popular being Zoomify, Debugify and YetAnotherConfigLib, all of which are included in the
[most popular modpack](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/better-mc-fabric) for
[FabricMC](https://fabricmc.net).

### Beginnings

[EvergreenHUD](https://github.com/isXander/EvergreenHUD/tree/1.19) was my very first project developing
Minecraft mods and has influenced me a lot. It was a very simple mod that added HUD elements, displaying
useful information on the screen. It became increasingly popular under the relatively small community
I released it in, becoming the standard for Forge HUD mods on 1.8.9. Eventually, I was attracted to
developing for modern versions of Minecraft, where I ended up rewriting the whole mod in Kotlin,
learning the language along the way, and upgrading the mod target from 1.8.9 to 1.18.

From developing this mod, I learned about the basic of annotation processors, making an intuitive API for
other mods to depend from and the basics of Kotlin and how it can be utilised for cleaner code. Along with an
important lesson of how to understand the needs of my users and interacting with my own community.

Today, the mod still lives on under new maintainers, [Polyfrost](https://github.com/orgs/Polyfrost).

## Commissions

### Ape Initiative

In early April 2023, I took a commission for a youtuber, [ChisDaCow](https://youtube.com/@ChrisDaCow)
where I had to create a touchscreen control scheme to allow chimpanzees to play Minecraft. He then took this
mod to [Ape Initiative](https://www.apeinitiative.org/) in Iowa where Kanzi, the eldest of the apes,
learned how to break blocks with my controls in just 30 minutes! According to the researchers, this was the 
most advanced thing they had ever done on a screen!

I achieved this by collaborating with the youtuber to come up with a data-driven, configurable touch 
interface with rows, columns and [lexigram](https://www.apeinitiative.org/lexigrams) buttons where I then
heavily modified Minecraft so it can be controlled in game with just single taps, without the need for a 
mouse and keyboard.

Below you can see a demonstration of the mod, using a mouse as a finger, as I don't own a touchscreen
device:

A video was published to YouTube about this topic, which includes me speaking about the mod.

### Socksfor1 YouTuber

In January 2022, I joined a private Discord server with a group of YouTubers who were interested in
paying commissioners to create their unique video idea, and a group of commissioners, who where intersted
in taking said commissions, one of whom was me.

A request would pop up in a channel and the first to claim it, got it. I claimed one commission posted
by [Socksfor1](https://youtube.com/c/socksfor1). The commission was to create a mod where players would
spawn on the moon, with the objective of a team of hunters who had a compass tracking a player who was progressing
by finding blocks and getting custom items such as a laser gun.

## My YouTube Channel

I got a youtube video to go viral by taking advantage of a trend and using an extremely simple AI that
I created to quickly scan through video clips, identify that faces are present in a frame against a folder of images,
and export those scenes into a folder which I then quickly edited together into a complete video.

You can find the OSS project [here](https://github.com/isXander/FaceFinder).

The result was an entertaining video:

I tried to then repeat the same formula with other characters from the show which did not take off in the
same way as the first.
