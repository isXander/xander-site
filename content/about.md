# :wave: I'm Xander

I create Minecraft mods using Kotlin and Java, I love doing what I'm doing. My mods are on [GitHub](https://github.com/isXander?tab=repositories&q=minecraft+mod), [Curseforge](https://www.curseforge.com/members/xanderisdev) and [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/user/isxander). I have also tinkered with some statistical analysis and AI with [Python](https://github.com/isXander?tab=repositories&language=python).

# My Successes

## Minecraft Mods

As of August 2022, I have reached over 2 million total downloads on [Curseforge](https://www.curseforge.com/members/xanderisdev) alone, making a nice bonus of revenue, my most popular being [Zoomify](https://curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/zoomify) (a simple zoom mod), and [Debugify](https://curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/debugify) (a mod that fixes bugs in the game), both being included in the [most popular modpack](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/better-mc-fabric) for [FabricMC](https://fabricmc.net).

## Youtube

I got a video to go semi-viral using an extremely simple AI I made to scan video clips and identify faces against a folder of images, this program then outputs "scenes" (or clips) where the faces were present to then easily edit into [a compilation video](https://https://youtu.be/erhUvfL4crM). **This project is called [FaceFinder](https://github.com/isXander/FaceFinder).**
