# Contact Me

There are many reasons you may want to contact me, but some questions/enquiries may be better
answered on [my public discord server](https://short.isxander.dev/discord). You can create user support threads or just
ask in `#general`. For most things, this will be what you want.

## Business Enquiries

If you'd like to do business with me you can either contact me through Discord private messages [`(@isxander)`](https://discord.com/users/320596098689400833) (where I will reply the fastest)
or contact me through my [business email](mailto:business@isxander.dev). This could be anything from partnerships and advertising to commissioning Minecraft mods for your YouTube channel or other platform. I have done multiple high-profile commissions, which you can read
more about on my [about page](/about/#commissions).
