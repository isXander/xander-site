From a very young age, I have been interested in photography. I just felt like I needed to capture sights like no one had seen them before. Taking shots that stood out in the crowd of mediocre smartphone pictures.

At 10 years old, I was given a Samsung Galaxy S10, the first device I owned with a decent camera system. I experimented with all three lesnes, the main sensor, the ultrawide and the telephoto. I found my passion with landscape photography. Later, I upgraded to a Pixel 6 Pro, where I really developed my understanding of what makes a great photo.

I have also started an instagram where I post new photos [here](https://instagram.com/xander.pics).

## My Current Equipment

- Canon EOS R10 - I saved up Â£1000 of my own money to buy this in late 2022.
  - RF-S 18-45mm F4.5-6.3 IS STM - Kit lens
- DJI Air 2S - A photography drone that I use to take pictures I would never have been able to get before.
- Pixel 6 Pro - My camera for on-the-go.
