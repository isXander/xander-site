I have started an instagram where I post new photos [here](https://instagram.com/xander.pics).

## My Current Equipment

- Canon EOS R10 - I saved up Â£1000 of my own money to buy this in late 2022.
  - RF-S 18-45mm F4.5-6.3 IS STM Kit
- DJI Air 2S - A photography drone that I use to take pictures I would never have been able to get before.
- Pixel 6 Pro - My camera for on-the-go.
